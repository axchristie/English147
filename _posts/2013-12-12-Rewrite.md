# Creative Rewrite Exercise
## Speculating with Oscar Wilde
<br>
This activity asks us to grapple and wrangle with the work of close reading by speculating how our texts might read differently. For this exercise, we will look at Gwendolen's conversation with Ernest (Jack) at the end of Act I in groups. Each group will rewrite and act out their own version of this scene, reimagining it through a key interpretive element. Emphasizing and linking textual details to craft a creative, coherent, and convincing view of a scene relies on the same critical thinking skills used to close reading. Manipulating how this scene could play differently, then, helps build our interpretive capacity by turning close reading inside-out.
